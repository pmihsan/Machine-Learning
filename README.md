# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Introduction
This repositry contains notebook files which includes fundamentals of data processing, how to handle data using numpy and pandas, how to visualize data using matplotlib and seaborn, and a basic intro into image classification by building a simple CNN model.

## Algorithms
It also has a collection of notebooks of machine learning algorithms classified into supervised and unsupervised learning.

### Supervised Learning
+ Linear Regression
+ Logistic Regression
+ Decision Tree
+ Naive Bayes
+ K Nearest Neighbors(KNN)

### Unsupervised Learning
+ K Means Clustering 
+ Principal Component Analysis(PCA)

The above algorithms are implemented using built in library functions. Additionally it also includes basic regression and classification tasks using Neural Networks(NN) and Multi Layer Perceptron(MLP).

### Applications
> Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used for Language Detection.

> LSTM(RNN - Recurrent Neural Network) used for Microsoft Stock Price Prediction.

> Gold Price and Diabetes Prediction using simple neural network.
